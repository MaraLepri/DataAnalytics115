# DataAnalytics115

For this class, I have copied some data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development: 
https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2020-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html

I created a scatterplot which reveals that there is a relationship between the number of males, females, non-chronically homeless. It's fairly straightforward: with this positive relationship, if there is a high number of any one of these categories, the other categories are likely to also have a higher number. These are strong correlations, greater than 0.90 for all categories. 

For non-binary folks, they were only somewhat related to chronically homeless people and unsheltered people, with correlations of about 0.70. The relationship drops off from there, from 0.60 down to 0.40 prediciton of increased numbers in other categories. 

Here is that visual, and it's in my repository as well. The last two tabs say Chronically Sheltered and then Chronically Unsheltered. Apologies for the formatting there. I will try to fix it when I have some free time.
